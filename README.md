For this assignment, we want you to apply the design principles from this quarter to create a personal portfolio website that you could share for job interviews.
  
## Portfolio Details  
Your portfolio website should have the following elements:  

* A landing page with at least two showcase projects. Make these visually appealing.
* You should be able to click on at least one of the projects to read / see more information.
* A link to your resume (you can either create a resume in HTML or link to an external document).
* A link to your bio, also created with HTML and CSS.
* Access to personal contact information.
* Some kind of menu or navigation system for your site.
* Make sure that your website follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Be advised that making no effort to adhere to the WCAG will result in an automatic 5 point deduction.
  
You can get up to 5 points of extra credit for including at least two items from the following list:
* Data Collection FormLinks to an external site.
* Data VisualizationLinks to an external site.
* User ProfilesLinks to an external site.
* External Content IntegrationLinks to an external site.

What to Hand In  
Publish your portfolio on github and submit the link to your code and to the published site.  
You can find out how to publish a page using github.io at https://pages.github.com/  
You can also ask the teaching team about how to publish a page using github.io.  
For this assignment please **do not use existing CSS templates or frameworks**. We want you to practice your CSS skills and build the site from scratch.
